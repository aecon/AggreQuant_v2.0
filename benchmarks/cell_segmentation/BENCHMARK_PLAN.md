# Cell Segmentation Benchmark — Implementation Plan

**Date**: 2026-02-25
**Location**: `AggreQuant_paper/benchmarks/cell_segmentation/`
**Conda environment**: `nuclei-bench` (shared with nuclei benchmark)

---

## 1. Objective

Compare pretrained whole-cell segmentation models on the same HCS images used
in the nuclei benchmark (FarRed channel), with DAPI as an optional nuclear hint.
No manual ground truth — evaluation is based on inter-model agreement, per-category
count comparison, and inference speed.

Produces a **supplementary figure** for the AggreQuant methods paper
(Cell Reports Methods), paired with the nuclei segmentation figure.

---

## 2. Relationship to the Nuclei Benchmark

The images are the **same 90 FOVs** used in the nuclei benchmark, from the same
SpeedDrive directory:

```
/media/athena/SpeedDrive/ATHENA/PROJECT_AggreQuant/
  2026_02_18_BENCHMARCKS/NUCLEI-BENCHMARK_AE-CURATED-2026-02-19/
```

- Nuclei benchmark: uses `*wv 390 - Blue*` (DAPI) as primary channel.
- Cell benchmark: uses `*wv 631 - FarRed*` (cell membrane/cytoplasm) as primary
  channel, with DAPI available as a nuclear hint for two-channel configurations.

`data/images` is a symlink to the same SpeedDrive directory.
Reuses the `nuclei-bench` conda environment (Cellpose, DeepCell, InstanSeg).

## 3. Models and Configurations (8 total)

Models that are nuclei-specific (StarDist `2D_versatile_fluo`, DeepCell
`NuclearSegmentation`, Cellpose `nuclei`) are excluded — they are not meaningful
on a cytoplasmic channel.

### Single-channel (FarRed only)

| ID | Model | Channels | Notes |
|----|-------|----------|-------|
| `cellpose_cyto2` | Cellpose cyto2 | `[0, 0]` | FarRed only, auto-diameter |
| `cellpose_cyto3` | Cellpose cyto3 | `[0, 0]` | FarRed only, auto-diameter |
| `deepcell_mesmer` | Mesmer | `[zeros, FarRed]` | Membrane only; compartment=`whole-cell` |
| `instanseg_fluorescence` | InstanSeg | `(H, W)` | Single-channel FarRed; target=`cells` |

### Two-channel (FarRed + DAPI nuclear hint)

| ID | Model | Channels | Notes |
|----|-------|----------|-------|
| `cellpose_cyto2_with_nuc` | Cellpose cyto2 | `[1, 2]` → `[FarRed, DAPI]` | Cytoplasm + nuclear hint |
| `cellpose_cyto3_with_nuc` | Cellpose cyto3 | `[1, 2]` → `[FarRed, DAPI]` | Cytoplasm + nuclear hint |
| `deepcell_mesmer_with_nuc` | Mesmer | `[DAPI, FarRed]` | Nuclear + membrane; compartment=`whole-cell` |
| `instanseg_fluorescence_with_nuc` | InstanSeg | `(2, H, W)` → `[DAPI, FarRed]` | Two-channel; target=`cells` |

### Channel conventions

**Cellpose** `channels=[1, 2]`: index-1 in the (H, W, 2) array is cytoplasm;
index-2 is the nuclear hint.
```python
img_2ch = np.stack([img_cell, img_nuc], axis=-1)  # img[:,:,0]=FarRed, img[:,:,1]=DAPI
masks = model.eval(img_2ch, channels=[1, 2], ...)
```

**Mesmer without nuclear**: provide zeros for the nuclear channel (channel 0).
```python
img_2ch = np.stack([np.zeros_like(img_cell), img_cell], axis=-1)  # (H, W, 2)
```

**Mesmer with nuclear**: standard Mesmer convention is `[nuclear, membrane]`.
```python
img_2ch = np.stack([img_nuc, img_cell], axis=-1)  # (H, W, 2)
labels = app.predict(img_4d, image_mpp=0.325, compartment="whole-cell")
```

**InstanSeg** two-channel: `(2, H, W)` with `[DAPI, FarRed]` order.
```python
img_2ch = np.stack([img_nuc, img_cell], axis=0).astype(np.float32)  # (2, H, W)
result = model.eval_small_image(img_2ch, pixel_size=image_mpp, target="cells")
```

## 4. Input Data

### Directory Structure

```
cell_segmentation/data/images -> SpeedDrive/NUCLEI-BENCHMARK_AE-CURATED-2026-02-19/
  ├── 01_low_confluency/
  │   ├── *wv 390 - Blue*.tif    (DAPI — nuclear hint)
  │   └── *wv 631 - FarRed*.tif  (primary — cell channel)
  ├── 02_high_confluency/
  ├── 03_clustered_touching/

  ├── 06_flatfield_inhomogeneity/
  ├── 07_low_intensity/
  ├── 08_high_intensity/
  └── 09_debris_artifacts/
```

- 90 FarRed images total; every image has a matching DAPI file.
- Primary: `*wv 631 - FarRed*.tif` (uint16, single-channel).
- Nuclear hint: derived by replacing `wv 631 - FarRed` → `wv 390 - Blue` in filename.

## 8. Execution Checklist

- [ ] Verify `nuclei-bench` env is active and all imports work
- [ ] Confirm symlink `data/images` resolves to SpeedDrive
- [ ] Run `run_benchmark.py --data-dir data/images`
- [ ] Inspect `results/counts.csv` and `results/timing.csv`
- [ ] Run `plot_results.py` to generate panels A–E
- [ ] Run `plot_masks.py` to generate panel F mask gallery
- [ ] Manually curate/annotate panel F if needed
